Light-winged Smoke, Icarian <span>{{madlib.animal}}</span>,  <br>

Melting thy pinions in thy <span>{{madlib.direction}}</span> flight,  <br>

Lark without song, and messenger of <span>{{madlib.timeOfDay}}</span>,  <br>

Circling above <span>{{madlib.place}}</span> as thy nest;  <br>

Or else, departing dream, and shadowy form <br> 

Of <span>{{madlib.time}}</span> vision, gathering up thy skirts; <br> 

By night star-veiling, and by day  <br>

Darkening the <span>{{madlib.noun}}</span> and blotting out the sun; <br> 

Go thou my incense upward from this hearth,  <br>

And ask the gods to pardon this <span>{{madlib.color}}</span> flame. <br>
